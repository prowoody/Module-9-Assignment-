I created an ERD by parsing through the CSV files and it is attached as a JPG. SQL_analysis has the queries I ran for the questions and SQL_employee has all the tables created with the relevant columns for import. The result images contains the JPG of the screenshots for the queries as they all couldn't be exported to CSV due to their size. A word document for the analysis answers the questions and provides screen shots of the code.
